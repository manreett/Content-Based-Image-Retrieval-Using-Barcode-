# Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) Using Barcode

-  # Description 
The  project is Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR), which is a real-world problem. For this project, the image retrieval will search the contents using barcodes. Given a MNIST folder containing a set of handwritten digits from 0 to 9, with ten images per digit, totalling to 100 images, a barcode will be generated to present each image. Using the barcode, a searching algorithm will compare the query image with other images and find the best match. The retrieval accuracy will be reported by calculating the hit ratio (%). Afterwards, Big-O complexity analysis will be conducted for the barcode generator algorithm and the search algorithm.
